          <img src="images/becky-headshot2.jpg"/>
          <p>
            Rebecca Tarbotton, known to friends as Becky, was a profound thinker and leader. She was dedicated to merging environmental and social justice movements towards transformational changes in forest protection, climate change and human rights. A self-proclaimed “pragmatic idealist”, Becky was deeply admired by a whole movement of activists for her boldness and clarity of vision.

            We don't always know exactly what it is that creates social change. It takes everything from science all the way to faith, and it's that fertile place right in the middle where really exceptional campaigning happens - and that is where I strive to be.
