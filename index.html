          <h2>Fundraising Update - December 2016</h2>

          <!--p>
        <b>Exciting news!</b>  
        <br><br>
        We have now raised <b>$56,000</b> towards our goal of <b>$90,000</b>.  We are deeply honored and grateful that so many people around the world have contributed to the Becky Tarbotton Memorial Scholarship.  Donations of any amount are still being accepted and will go a long way to helping us realize our goal. If you haven't already, please take a moment to checkout the link below and make a contribution.
        </p-->

        <p>
        The scholarship fund was launched in January and as of November generous donors have given over <b> $64,000 </b> to the fund - more than 2/3 of our <b> $90,000 </b> goal. We are incredibly grateful for the donations that have been made so far in Becky’s memory. The inaugural awarding of the scholarship is planned for May 2017 and will be for $2,000 based on the funds raised to date.  However, if we successfully reach our goal of $90,000, subsequent awards will be increased to $3,000 raising the scholarship’s impact and significance.

          <h2>The Scholarship</h2>

          <p>
          The Becky Tarbotton Memorial Scholarship has been set up in memory of Rebecca (“Becky”) Tarbotton  at the UBC School of Community and Regional Planning (SCARP) to support individuals who demonstrate exceptional leadership and commitment in the fields of environmental and social justice. Becky was a leader and visionary who dedicated her career to protecting the environment and defending human rights. 
        </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to raise <b> $90,000 </b> so that we can award $3000 annually to an individual who shares Becky's vision for the planet and strives for transformative change. 
          </p>
          

          <p>
              <b> With your help we can inspire future leaders to continue Becky's work.  </b>
          </p>

          <h2>About Becky</h2>
          <img src="images/becky-headshot2.jpg"/>
          <p>
            Rebecca Tarbotton, known to friends as Becky, was a profound thinker and leader. She was dedicated to merging environmental and social justice movements towards transformational changes in forest protection, climate change and human rights. A self-proclaimed “pragmatic idealist”, Becky was deeply admired by a whole movement of activists for her boldness and clarity of vision.

          <blockquote>
            We don't always know exactly what it is that creates social change. It takes everything from science all the way to faith, and it's that fertile place right in the middle where really exceptional campaigning happens - and that is where I strive to be.
