  <!-- Benefits
  ================================================== -->


          <p>The Becky Tarbotton Memorial Scholarship supports a second year graduate student in the School of Community and Regional Planning at the University of British Columbia who demonstrates exceptional leadership and commitment in the fields of environmental and social justice. </p>

        <p>
          In order for the Becky Tarbotton Scholarship to be awarded in perpetuity, the funds we raise will be invested in the <a href="http://www.ubcimant.ca/investments/endowment-fund.php">UBC Endowment Fund</a>.  As of 2015, a portion of the funds are invested in the Energy Industry.  However, In 2012, UBC developed the <a href="http://treasury.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/04/ubc-endowment-responsible-investment-policy-apr2014.pdf">Endowment Responsible Investment Policy </a> which sets out the conditions under which disinvestment may occur. Importantly, both UBC Students and Facility voted in support of disinvestment in non-biding referendums in 2014. Becky would have have been highly supportive of the UBC faculty and students disinvestment efforts and their pursuit of other sustainability initiatives related to the Endowment Fund.  <a = href"http://www.scarp.ubc.ca/mission-and-goals">SCARP’s vision and mission </a>, which align with Becky’s, are focused on advancing sustainability and it is our hope that recipient of the Becky Tarbotton Scholarship will actively work, both globally and at the University, to make progress in this regard.
